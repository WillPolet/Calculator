    <h1>This is my calculator, feel free to use it (not to do 1+1 please)</h1>
    <p>Disclaimer : This is a js calculator, so don't try to do 0.1 + 0.2, you must be surprised. Either π is not precise, so for exemple sin(π) is not equel to 0. You cannot use trigonometric functions with degree as well...</p>
    <p>Yeah I know it's a pretty bad calculator, js sucks for calculate...</p>
